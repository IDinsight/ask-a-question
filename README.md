## Usage

To get answers from your database of contents, you can use the `/search` endpoint. This endpoint returns the following:

- Search results: Finds the most similar content in the database using cosine distance between embeddings.
- (Optionally) LLM generated response: Crafts a custom response using LLM chat using the most similar content.

See [docs](https://docs.ask-a-question.com/) or [API docs](https://app.ask-a-question.com/api/redoc) for more details and other API endpoints.

### :question: Simple content search

```shell
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://[DOMAIN]/api/search' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <BEARER TOKEN>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "query_text": "how are you?",
  "generate_llm_response": false,
  "query_metadata": {}
}'
```

### :robot: With LLM response

The query looks the same as above, except `generate_llm_response` is set to `true`:

```shell
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://[DOMAIN]/api/search' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <BEARER TOKEN>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "query_text": "this is my question",
  "generate_llm_response": true,
  "query_metadata": {}
}'
```

### :books: Manage content

You can access the admin console at

```
https://[DOMAIN]/
```

## Architecture

We use docker-compose to orchestrate containers with a reverse proxy that manages all incoming traffic to the service. The database and LiteLLM proxy are only accessed by the core app.
