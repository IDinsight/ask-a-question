# Setting up your development environment

## Step 1: Fork the repository

Please fork the
[project repository](https://github.com/IDinsight/ask-a-question) by clicking on the
"Fork" button. Then, clone the repo using your own GitHub handle:

    git clone git@github.com:<your GitHub handle>/ask-a-question.git

For questions related to setup, please contact
[AAQ Support](mailto:aaq@idinsight.org?Subject=AAQ%20Setup%20Help)

## Step 2: Configure environment variables

1. Navigate to the `deployment/docker-compose` directory.

    ```shell
    cd ask-a-question/deployment/docker-compose
    ```

2. Copy `template.*.env` into new files named `.*.env` within the same directory:

    ```shell
    cp template.common.env .common.env
    cp template.core_backend.env .core_backend.env
    cp template.litellm_proxy.env .litellm_proxy.env
    ```

3. Update `.litellm_proxy.env` to enable LiteLLM Proxy Server to authenticate to LLM services. This is sufficient for local
   development setup. See [Configuring AAQ](../deployment/config-options.md) for more
   information about other environment variables.

4. (optional) Edit which LLMs are used in the
   [`litellm_proxy_config.yaml`](https://github.com/IDinsight/ask-a-question/blob/main/deployment/docker-compose/litellm_proxy_config.yaml).

## Step 3: Set up your development environment

Once you are done with steps [1](#step-1-fork-the-repository) &
[2](#step-2-configure-environment-variables), there are two ways to set up your development environment for AAQ:

1. [Docker Compose Watch](#set-up-using-docker-compose-watch)
2. [Manual](#set-up-manually)

You can view the [pros and cons of each method](#pros-and-cons-of-each-setup-method) at
the bottom.

### Set up using [Docker Compose Watch](https://docs.docker.com/compose/file-watch/)

#### Install prerequisites

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. If you are not using
[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), install
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) with version \>=2.22 to use
the `watch` command.

#### Run `docker compose watch`

If not done already, configure the environment variables in [Step 2](#step-2-configure-environment-variables).

1. In the `deployment/docker-compose` directory, run

    ```shell
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p aaq-stack watch
    ```

    ??? note "Here's what you should see if the above command executes successfully"
            ✔ Network aaq-stack_default            Created
            ✔ Volume "aaq-stack_db_volume"         Created
            ✔ Volume "aaq-stack_caddy_data"        Created
            ✔ Volume "aaq-stack_caddy_config"      Created
            ✔ Container aaq-stack-caddy-1          Started
            ✔ Container aaq-stack-litellm_proxy-1  Started
            ✔ Container aaq-stack-relational_db-1  Started
            ✔ Container aaq-stack-core_backend-1   Started
            ✔ Container aaq-stack-admin_app-1      Started
            Watch enabled

    The app will now run and update with any changes made to the `core_backend` or
    `admin_app` folders.

    The admin app will be available on [https://localhost](https://localhost) and the
    backend API testing UI on [https://localhost/api/docs](https://localhost/api/docs).

2. To stop AAQ, first exit the running app process in your terminal with
`ctrl+c` and then run:

    ```shell
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p aaq-stack down
    ```

### Set up manually

#### Install prerequisites

1. Install
   [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).
2. Install [Node.js v19](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

    ??? note "Setting up a different NodeJS version"
        If you have a different NodeJS version installed already, you can switch to a
        different version by installing
        [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and then executing

        ```bash
        nvm install 19
        nvm use 19
        ```

3. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
4. (optional) Install [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). `make` is used
to run commands (targets) in `Makefile`s and can be used to automate various setup
procedures.

#### Set up the backend

0. Navigate to `ask-a-question` repository root.

    ```shell
    cd ask-a-question
    ```

1. Set up your Python environment by creating a new conda environment using `make`.

    ```shell
    make fresh-env
    ```

    This command will remove any existing `aaq` conda environment and create a new
    `aaq` conda environment with the required Python packages.

    <a name="psycopg2"></a>
    ??? warning "Errors with `psycopg2`?"
        `psycopg2` vs `psycopg2-binary`: For production use cases we should use
        `psycopg2` but for local development, `psycopg2-binary` suffices and is often
        easier to install. If you are getting errors from `psycopg2`, try installing
        `psycopg2-binary` instead.

        If you would like `psycopg2-binary` instead of `psycopg2`, run
        `make fresh-env psycopg_binary=true` instead (see below for why you may want
        this).

        See [here](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html#psycopg-vs-psycopg-binary)
        for more details.

    <a name="manual-python-setup"></a>
    ??? note "Setting up the Python environment manually"
        **Create virtual environment**

            conda create --name aaq python=3.10

        **Install Python packages**

            pip install -r core_backend/requirements.txt
            pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

        **Install pre-commit**

         [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) is used to ensure that code changes
         are formatted correctly. It is only necessary if you are planning on making
         changes to the codebase.

            pre-commit install

2. Activate your `aaq` conda environment.

    ```shell
    conda activate aaq
    ```

3. Set up the required Docker containers by running

    ```shell
    make setup-dev
    ```

    As of now, this will start up

    - PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
    - LiteLLM Proxy Server
    - Redis

    ??? note "Setting up the DB, LiteLLM Proxy Server, and Redis seprately"

        If you would like to set
        up each of these dependencies *separately*, check out the [Makefile](https://github.com/IDinsight/ask-a-question/blob/main/Makefile) at repository root.

4. Export the environment variables you defined earlier in [Step
   2](#step-2-configure-environment-variables) by running

    ```shell
    set -a
    source deployment/docker-compose/.common.env
    source deployment/docker-compose/.core_backend.env
    set +a
    ```

    ??? note "Saving environment variables in `aaq` conda environment"

        You can set environment variables by either running `conda env config vars set <NAME>=<VALUE>` for each required environment variable, or [save them in the environment activation script](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#saving-environment-variables).

5. Start the backend app.

    ```shell
    python core_backend/main.py
    ```

    ??? note "Here's what you should see if the above command executes successfully"

        ```
        INFO:     Will watch for changes in these directories: ['~/ask-a-question']
        INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
        INFO:     Started reloader process [73855] using StatReload
        INFO:     Started server process [73858]
        INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
        07/15/2024 12:29:08 PM          __init__.py  79 : Application started
        INFO:     Application startup complete.
        ```

    This will launch the application in "reload" mode (i.e., the app will automatically
    refresh everytime you make a change to one of the files).

    You can test the endpoint for the API documentation by going to
    [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) (the backend itself runs
    on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)).

6. To stop the backend app, first exit the running app process in your terminal with
`ctrl+c` and then run:

    ```shell
    make teardown-dev
    ```

#### Set up the frontend

0. Navigate to `ask-a-question` repository root and activate the
`aaq` virtual environment:

    ```shell
    cd ask-a-question
    ```

    ```shell
    conda activate aaq
    ```

1. In a *new* terminal:

    ```shell
    cd admin_app
    nvm use 19
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

    ??? note "Here's what you should see if the above commands execute successfully"

        ```
        > admin-app@0.2.0 dev
        > next dev

        ▲ Next.js 14.1.3
        - Local:        http://localhost:3000

        ✓ Ready in 1233ms
        ```

    This will install the required NodeJS packages for the admin app and start the
    admin app in `dev` (i.e., autoreload) mode. The admin app will now be accessible on
    [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

    You can login with either the default credentials
    (username: `admin`, password: `fullaccess`) or the ones you specified
    in `.core_backend.env`.

2. To stop the admin app, exit the running app process in your terminal with
`ctrl`+`c`.

### Pros and cons of each setup method

| Method | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Set up using docker compose watch](#set-up-using-docker-compose-watch) | <ul><li>Good for end-to-end testing</li><li>Local environment identical to production deployment</li><li>No need to setup local environment</li><li>Set environment variables and configs once</li></ul> | <ul><li>Changes take 20-30s to be reflected in the app</li></ul> |
| [Set up manually](#set-up-manually)| <ul><li>Instant feedback from changes</li></ul>| <ul><li>Requires more configuration before each run</li><li>Requires environment and dependencies to be set up correctly</li><ul> |


## Step 4: Set up docs

---
**Note**

Ensure that you are in the `ask-a-question` project directory and that you have activated the
`aaq` virtual environment before proceeding.

---

To host docs offline so that you can see documentation changes in real-time, run the
following from `ask-a-question` repository root with an altered port (so that it doesn't
interfere with the app's server):

```shell
mkdocs serve -a localhost:8080
```
