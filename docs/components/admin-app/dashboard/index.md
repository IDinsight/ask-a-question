# Dashboard

The Dashboard provides real-time analytics on the performance of your solution. There
are four time filters available: _Last 24 hours_, _Last week_, _Last month_, and _Last year_.

The dashboard is divided into three sections: [Overview](#overview), [Performance](#performance), and [Content Gaps](#insights).

## Overview

This landing page of the dashboard provides a high-level summary of the performance of your solution.

## Performance

This section show how well your content is performing. You can sort the content by
the number of times it was shared with your users, upvotes or downvotes, and even the
trend (is it getting more or less popular).

suggestion on how to improve the content.
