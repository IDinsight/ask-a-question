# Question-Answering Service

`/search` is the flagship endpoint that your application can integrate with:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-api:{ .lg .middle } __Search__

    ---

    Allows searching through the content database using embeddings similarity and
    optionally creates an LLM-generated answer to the user's question.

## Capturing Feedback

The service also provides two endpoint to capture feedback from users. One to capture
feedback for the response returned and the other for the content items retrieved.

For both of these, you can provide feedback as sentiment ("positive", "negative"),
as text, or as both.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-api:{ .lg .middle } __Response Feedback__

    ---

    Allows users to provide feedback on the response generated by the either Semantic Search or LLM Response.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: More info](./response-feedback.md)

- :material-api:{ .lg .middle } __Content Feedback__

    ---

    Allows users to provide feedback on the content items returned by the Semantic Search.
