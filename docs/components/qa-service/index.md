## Capturing Feedback

The service also provides two endpoint to capture feedback from users. One to capture
feedback for the response returned and the other for the content items retrieved.

For both of these, you can provide feedback as sentiment ("positive", "negative"),
as text, or as both.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-api:{ .lg .middle } __Response Feedback__

    ---

    Allows users to provide feedback on the response generated by the either Semantic Search or LLM Response.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: More info](./response-feedback.md)

- :material-api:{ .lg .middle } __Content Feedback__

    ---

    Allows users to provide feedback on the content items returned by the Semantic Search.
