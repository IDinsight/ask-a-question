# Hugging Face Embeddings

_Get more control of your data by using open-source embeddings from Hugging Face_

By default, AAQ uses
[OpenAI text embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings)
to generate text vectors. But we give the option of deploying and hosting custom Hugging Face
[embedding models](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard).

**Note**

Hugging Face has an extensive list of embeddings models, some lightweight and
some heavy. Please carefully choose the model that will fit your use case best.
