# Get more control of your data with Custom Embeddings

By default, AAQ uses
[OpenAI text embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings)
to generate text vectors. But we give the option of deploying and hosting custom huggingface
[embedding models](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard).

---

**Note**

Huggingface has an extensive list of embeddings models, some lightweight and
some heavy. Please carefully choose the model that will fit your use case best.
