# Introducing Multi-turn Chat

Ever wanted to ask follow-up questions without losing context from previous answers?
Weâ€™ve now got you covered with our brand-new **multi-turn chat** endpoint. Just keep asking, and the chat remembers what you said before.

## Why did we build this?

Managing user question on-the-fly often means juggling multiple questions and follow-ups. This can get tricky when new messages layer onto an ongoing conversation. Multi-turn chat solves that by keeping track of your entire conversation history, so your questions can seamlessly connect to prior answers.
