# Revamping the dashboard

In the last month or so, we've had support from Google fellows to pinch hit on a few items.
Ahn Mac, a UI/UX designer at Google, helped design a new dashboard that we are very excited about.
The first page, "Overview", is now ready for you to check out.

## Why did we build this?

The ethos of AAQ is that you care deeply about your users and are continuously refining
and adding content to improve user experience. A live dashboard is the first step. It
allows you to understand the usage of your solution, your users, and their feedback.

Also, it wouldn't be an IDinsight product without a decent dashboard!
