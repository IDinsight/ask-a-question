# Eating documents for breakfast -- introducing DocMuncher

Content cards are great, but what if all your information lives in documents? No problem -- now you can just upload the documents and turn them into cards!

<!-- more -->

## What does DocMuncher do?

On the Admin App, you can now upload either .zip files or .pdfs, in addition to creating content cards directly.

The backend then converts the document into bite-sized chunks that get turned into content cards.

This is the first version that we have for ingesting documents, but we're planning to build clustering for semantically similar cards and paraphrasing them so they're more readable.
