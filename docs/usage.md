There are two ways to interact with the service:

1. Accessing the **API endpoints**
2. The **Admin App**

## API endpoints

To get answers from your database of contents, you can use the `/search` endpoint. This endpoint returns the following:

- Search results: Finds the most similar content in the database using cosine distance between embeddings.
- (Optionally) LLM generated response: Crafts a custom response using LLM chat using the most similar content.

You can also add your contents programatically using API endpoints. See our [API docs](https://app.ask-a-question.com/api/redoc) for more details and other API endpoints.

### :question: Embeddings search

```
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://[DOMAIN]/api/search' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <BEARER TOKEN>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "query_text": "how are you?",
  "generate_llm_response": false,
  "query_metadata": {}
}'
```

### :robot: LLM response

```
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://[DOMAIN]/api/search' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <BEARER TOKEN>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "query_text": "this is my question",
  "generate_llm_response": true,
  "query_metadata": {}
}'
```

## Admin app

You can access the admin app of AAQ's cloud version [here](https://app.ask-a-question.com). You can
also [self-host your own AAQ admin app](http://localhost:8080/deployment/quick-setup/).

On the admin app, you can:

- :books: Manage content and urgency rules
- :test_tube: Use the test sidebars to test the Question-Answering and Urgency Detection services
- :bar_chart: View dashboards

See more detailed documentation of the admin app
[here](http://localhost:8080/components/admin-app/).
