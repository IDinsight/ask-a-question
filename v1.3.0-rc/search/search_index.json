Here's why we decided to go for pgvector: - Simplified Architecture: By adopting pgvector, we significantly reduced the complexity of our data infrastructure. Vector and relational data now reside within the same database, eliminating the need for separate systems. - Improved Response Time: Direct integration with PostgreSQL enhances performance by eliminating the overhead of communicating between separate databases.</p> <p>Moving to pgvector not only benefits our team in terms of reduced complexity and better resource utilization but also lays the groundwork for future innovations such as the multilingual support which should be coming soon.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/07/22/one-endpoint-to-rule-them-all/","title":"One Endpoint to Rule Them All","text":"<p>We refactored our two question-answering endpoints into a single one called <code>/search</code> for clarity and ease of use.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/07/22/one-endpoint-to-rule-them-all/#why-change","title":"Why change?","text":"<p>We realised our two <code>/embeddings-search</code> and <code>/llm-response</code> endpoints were a bit confusing, and since they performed very similar tasks we combined them into one for ease of use.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/07/22/one-endpoint-to-rule-them-all/#whats-new","title":"What's new?","text":"<p>We now have a single endpoint called <code>/search</code> which always returns the top contents in the database that most closely matched your query and can optionally return an LLM-generated resposne to your question.</p> <p></p> <p>We've also simplified the parameters in our response model so it's easier to use.

Workspaces must be unique but can contain duplicated content. Users can be assigned to one or more workspaces, with different roles in each workspace. In other words, there is a many-to-many relationship between users and workspaces.</p> <p>Users do not have assigned quotas or API keys; rather, a user's API keys and quotas are tied to those of the workspaces they belong to. Furthermore, users must be unique across all workspaces.</p> <p>There are currently 2 different types of users:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Read-Only: These users are assigned to workspaces and can only read the contents within their assigned workspaces. They cannot modify existing contents or add new contents to their workspaces, add or delete users from their workspaces, or delete workspaces. However, read-only users can create new workspaces.</p> </li> <li> <p>Admin: These users are assigned to workspaces and can read and modify the contents within their assigned workspaces. They can also add or delete users from their assigned workspaces and can also add new workspaces or delete their own workspaces (assuming that there is at least one admin user left in that workspace). Admin users have no control over workspaces that they are not assigned to.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Other user types are possible (e.g., a <code>Content-Only</code> user or <code>Dashboard-Only</code> user).

However, existing workspaces can have content;     thus, we disable the ability to remove the last admin user from a workspace.</li> <li>A workspace cannot be deleted.
