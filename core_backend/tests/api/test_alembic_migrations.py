"""This module tests alembic migrations using `pytest-alembic`.

`pytest-alembic` defines two database fixtures, `alembic_config` and `alembic_engine`,
which are used to test the migrations. These fixtures are defined in the local
conftest.py.

NB: The `alembic_runner` fixture is used to skip alembic tests.
