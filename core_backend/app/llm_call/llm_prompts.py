                not previously discussed in the conversation.

            2. Obtain More Information to Help Address the User's LATEST MESSAGE:
                - Keep in mind the context given by the conversation history thus far.
                - Use the conversation history and the Type of the User's LATEST
                MESSAGE to formulate a precise query to execute against a vector
                database in order to retrieve the most relevant information that can
                address the user's LATEST MESSAGE given the context of the conversation
                history.
                - Ensure the vector database query is specific and accurately reflects
                the user's information needs.
                - Use specific keywords that captures the semantic meaning of the
                user's information needs.
